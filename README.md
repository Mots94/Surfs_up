Analyzing weather data using SQLite and Pandas

## Overview
In this analysis, the stakeholder would like to know if opening an ice cream shop on the island of Oahu, Hawaii would be sustainable year-round.  In order to answer this question, weather data was analyzed for the purpose of interpretation and to aid in the decision making process.  A SQLITE database containing eight years worth of weather data was used in this analysis.  The project stakeholder would like to know more about Oahu's temperature in the months of June and December, so the statistics generated were focused on those two months.
